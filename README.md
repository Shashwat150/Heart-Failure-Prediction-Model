# Heart-Failure-Prediction-Model

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the most common causes of death killing approximately 17 million people annually. The main reason behind CVD is the failure of the heart to pump blood normally. This dataset was created by combining different datasets already available independently but not combined before. In this dataset, 5 heart datasets are combined with over 11 common features which makes it the largest heart disease dataset available so far for research purposes. We proposed a machine-learning-based approach that distinguishes the most important correlated features amongst patientsâ€™ electronic clinical records. We applied Optimised hyperparameter classification algorithms like SVM, KNN, Light GBM, Random Forest, and Neural Network to obtain the best possible accuracy, F1 score, recall, and precision.


You can use the "code.ipynb" file to directly run the code on Google collab or Jupyter.
*Note- Make the necessary path changes while uploading the dataset. I have uploaded the dataset on drive and then mounted it on google collab to access it. You can also follow the same approach. The dataset is already provided in the repo.

We trained the following classifiers:

a) Decision Tree Classifier 
b) Support Vector Classifier
c) XGB Classifier
d) LGBM Classifier
e) Random Forest Classifier
f) K Neighbors Classifier
g) Deep Neural Network

*The results along with the accuracies are present in the report.
